Align-Anything is an open-source alignment framework for academic research based on DeepSpeed or NeMo (currently in development). It aims to align various modality large models (any-to-any models), including LLMs, VLMs, and others, with human intentions and values. More details about the definition and milestones of alignment for LLMs and other related information can be found in [AI Alignment](https://alignmentsurvey.com).

### Features

- Highly Modular Framework: Our framework offers a comprehensive collection of diverse alignment algorithms tailored for model alignment across various modalities. Its versatility stems from the abstraction of different algorithm types and a well-designed API, allowing users to easily modify and customize the code for different tasks.
- Support for Various Model Fine-Tuning: The framework includes fine-tuning capabilities for models such as LLaMA, LLaVA, Gemma, Qwen, Baichuan, and others (see [model-zoo](https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/align-anything/blob/main/Model-Zoo.md)).
- Support Alignment Fine-Tuning over Any Modality: It supports fine-tuning alignments for different modality model, including LLMs, VLMs, and other modalities (see [Development Roadmap](#development-roadmap)).
- Support Various Alignment Algorithms: The framework supports various alignment algorithms, including SFT, DPO, PPO, and others (see [example](https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/align-anything/tree/main/examples)).

#### Development Roadmap

We have a roadmap for future development work `align-anything`:

- [x] Support alignment algorithms over the `diffusion model`, `text to any generation model` and other `vision-language model`.
- [x] Support diverse parameter sizes including `LoRA`, `QLoRA`.
- [ ] Support `NeMo` backbone for training, and `vllm` backbone for evaluation.

# Train

## Quick Start

Quick start examples can be found at [here](./examples/)

To prepare for training, all scripts are located in the `./scripts`. Parameters that require user input have been left empty and must be filled in prior to initiating the training process. For example, for `ppo.sh`:

```bash
ACTOR_MODEL_NAME=""
REWARD_MODEL_NAME=""
CRITIC_MODEL_NAME=""
TRAIN_DATASETS=""
TRAIN_TEMPLATE=""
PTX_DATASET=""
PTX_TEMPLATE=""
OUTPUT_DIR=""

source ./setup.sh

  --actor_model_name_or_path ${ACTOR_MODEL_NAME} \
  --reward_model_name_or_path ${REWARD_MODEL_NAME} \

  --ptx_template ${PTX_TEMPLATE} \
  --output_dir ${OUTPUT_DIR}
```

<!-- TODO -->
- `ACTOR_MODEL_NAME`: The model to be fine-tuned, typically one that has already undergone initial supervised fine-tuning, like `PKU-Alignment/alpaca-7b-reproduced`.
- `REWARD_MODEL_NAME`: A model with a score output layer. Run `rm.sh` to train the reward model and obtain its path.
- `CRITIC_MODEL_NAME`: The model used for RLHF value function estimation, typically set to be the same as `REWARD_MODEL_NAME`.
- `TRAIN_DATASET`: The training dataset for RLHF, such as `PKU-Alignment/PKU-SafeRLHF`.
- `TRAIN_TEMPLATE`: The training template for RLHF, such as `PKU-Alignment/PKU-SafeRLHF`.
- `PTX_DATASET`: The supervised learning dataset to aid RLHF fine-tuning, like `tatsu-lab/alpaca`.
- `PTX_TEMPLATE`: The template for auxiliary supervised learning dataset in RLHF needs to be specified before training, and in this case, it is `Dialogue`.
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: The directory where you want to save the trained model, logging, and others.

### Some Training Bugs
1. If you encounter errors during the training process:

```bash
No such file or directory: ':/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc'
```

To include the CUDA installation path and set the environment variables, modify the script as follows:

```bash
export CUDA_HOME="/usr/local/cuda"
```
or
```bash
export CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX
```

The specific path depends on your `cuda` path.

## Customized Dataset

Align-anything offers a highly scalable dataset registration interface, enabling users to embed customized datasets simply by designing and specifying their `template.py`.

Taking [PKU-Alignment/PKU-SafeRLHF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-Alignment/PKU-SafeRLHF) as an example, we illustrate here how to design the template and incorporate it into a complete RLHF workflow.

The data key-value pairs for PKU-Alignment/PKU-SafeRLHF are as follows:

```python
{
  'prompt': '...',
  'response_0': '...',
  'response_1': '...',
  'better_response_id': 0
}
```

We first need to create a new template named PKUSafeRLHF for this dataset, and specify the required parameters such as system_prompt.

```python
@register_template('PKUSafeRLHF')
class PKUSafeRLHF(Template):
    system_prompt: str = 'BEGINNING OF CONVERSATION: '
    user_prompt: str = 'USER: {input} '
    assistant_prompt: str = 'ASSISTANT:{output}'
    split_token: str = 'ASSISTANT:'
```

### Reward modeling

The reward modeling requires the user to provide a dictionary with data keys as follows:

```python
{
  'better_text': '...',
  'worse_text': '...',
}
```

Therefore, the user needs to implement a key-value transformation logic in `align-anything/configs/template.py`, for instance, in this case:

```python
@register_template('PKUSafeRLHF')
class PKUSafeRLHF(Dialogue):

    def format_sample(self, raw_sample: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        metrics = raw_sample['better_response_id']
        better_response = raw_sample[f'response_{int(metrics)}']
        worse_response = raw_sample[f'response_{1-int(metrics)}']
        prompt = raw_sample['prompt']

        formatted_better_output = (
            f'{self.system_prompt}'
            f'{self.user_prompt.format(input=prompt)}'
            f'{self.assistant_prompt.format(output=better_response)}'
        )
        formatted_worse_output = (
            f'{self.system_prompt}'
            f'{self.user_prompt.format(input=prompt)}'
            f'{self.assistant_prompt.format(output=worse_response)}'
        )

        return {
            'better_text': formatted_better_output,
            'worse_text': formatted_worse_output,
        }
```

Here, `format_sample` parses the keys in the PKU-Alignment/PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, determines which response is better based on the `better_response_id`, and subsequently invokes previously defined parameters such as `system_prompt` to implement the transformation of key-value pairs.

### RL fine-tuning

During the RL fine-tuning phase, the model requires generation based on prompts within the dataset. Consequently, users need to implement key-value conversion in `template.py` using the following function:

```python
@register_template('PKUSafeRLHF')
class PKUSafeRLHF(Template):
    system_prompt: str = 'BEGINNING OF CONVERSATION: '
    user_prompt: str = 'USER: {input} '
    assistant_prompt: str = 'ASSISTANT:{output}'
    split_token: str = 'ASSISTANT:'

    def format_prompt_only_sample(self, raw_sample: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        prompt = raw_sample['prompt']

        formatted_prompt = (
            f'{self.system_prompt}'
            f'{self.user_prompt.format(input=prompt)}'
            f'{self.assistant_prompt.format(output="")}'
        )

        return {'text': formatted_prompt}
```

After designing the aforementioned template, you just need to specify this template by passing the `--train_template PKUSafeRLHF` argument when invoking the dataset to complete the corresponding training. Perhaps the above example still lacks specificity; therefore, we provide command references that encompass various models executing multiple algorithms on diverse datasets. You can expedite your training process by directly running or modifying these scripts [here](./examples/). For special task including `text image interleaved input and output` and  `any-to-text`, you can refer to [projects](./projects/).

# Evaluate

## Quick Start

To prepare for the evaluation, the script is located in the `./scripts directory`. Parameters requiring user input have been left empty and must be filled in before starting the evaluation process. For example, for `evaluate.sh`:

~~~bash
cd ../align_anything/evaluation

BENCHMARKS=("")
OUTPUT_DIR=""
GENERATION_BACKEND=""
MODEL_ID=""
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH=""
CHAT_TEMPLATE=""

for BENCHMARK in "${BENCHMARKS[@]}"; do
    python __main__.py \
        --benchmark ${BENCHMARK} \
        --output_dir ${OUTPUT_DIR} \
        --generation_backend ${GENERATION_BACKEND} \
        --model_id ${MODEL_ID} \
        --model_name_or_path ${MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH} \
        --chat_template ${CHAT_TEMPLATE}
done
~~~

- `BENCHMARKS`: One or more evaluation benchmarks or datasets for assessing the model's performance. For example, `("POPE" "MMBench")` can be used to evaluate the model on both the POPE and MMBench datasets. Each benchmark in the list will be processed sequentially.
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: The directory for saving the evaluation results and output files.
- `GENERATION_BACKEND`: The backend used for generating predictions, `vLLM` or `deepspeed`.
- `MODEL_ID`: Unique identifier for the model, used to track and distinguish model evaluations, like `llava-1.5-7b-hf`.
- `MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH`: The local path or Hugging Face link of model, such as `llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf`.
- `CHAT_TEMPLATE`: Chat template id of your model, like `LLAVA`. More details can be refered in `./align_anything/configs/template.py`.

To compare multiple models' performance across one or more benchmarks, located in the `./scripts`, the `models_pk.sh` script allows you to evaluate across different models and then compare their results. Ensure all parameters are correctly filled in before running the script.

~~~bash
cd ../align_anything/evaluation

BENCHMARKS=("")
OUTPUT_DIR=""
GENERATION_BACKEND=""
MODEL_IDS=("" "")
MODEL_NAME_OR_PATHS=("" "")
CHAT_TEMPLATES=("" "")

for BENCHMARK in "${BENCHMARKS[@]}"; do
    echo "Processing benchmark: ${BENCHMARK}"
    
    for i in "${!MODEL_IDS[@]}"; do
        MODEL_ID=${MODEL_IDS[$i]}
        MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH=${MODEL_NAME_OR_PATHS[$i]}
        CHAT_TEMPLATE=${CHAT_TEMPLATES[$i]}
        
        echo "Running model ${MODEL_ID} for benchmark ${BENCHMARK}"
        python __main__.py \
            --benchmark ${BENCHMARK} \
            --output_dir ${OUTPUT_DIR} \
            --generation_backend ${GENERATION_BACKEND} \
            --model_id ${MODEL_ID} \
            --model_name_or_path ${MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH} \
            --chat_template ${CHAT_TEMPLATE}
    done

    python models_pk.py --benchmark ${BENCHMARK} \
                        --model_1 "${MODEL_IDS[0]}" \
                        --model_2 "${MODEL_IDS[1]}"
done
~~~

- `BENCHMARKS`: One or more evaluation benchmarks or datasets for assessing the model's performance. For example, `("POPE" "MMBench")` can be used to evaluate the model on both the POPE and MMBench datasets. Each benchmark in the list will be processed sequentially.
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: The directory for saving the evaluation results and output files.
- `GENERATION_BACKEND`: The backend used for generating predictions, `vLLM` or `deepspeed`.
- `MODEL_IDS`: An array of two unique identifiers for the models being evaluated, such as `("llava-1.5-7b-hf" "llava-1.5-13b-hf")`. These IDs help track and distinguish between different model evaluations.
- `MODEL_NAME_OR_PATHS`: An array of two paths to the models' weights or their names if hosted on Hugging Face, such as `("llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf" "llava-hf/llava-1.5-13b-hf")`.
- `CHAT_TEMPLATES`: An array of two chat template IDs corresponding to each model, such as `("LLAVA" "LLAVA")`. This defines the format or style of responses generated by each model.

Additionally, you should modify the config file corresponding to the benchmark under `./align_anything/configs/evaluation/benchmarks` to adapt to specific evaluation tasks and specify test models.

For more inference parameters, please see `./align_anything/configs/evaluation/vllm` and `./align_anything/configs/evaluation/deepspeed`, depending on your generation backend.

# Inference

## Gradio Web UI

To launch a Gradio demo locally, follow these steps by running the commands one by one. If you intend to launch multiple model workers to compare different checkpoints, you only need to launch the controller and the web server *ONCE*.

### Launch a controller
```Shell
python -m align_anything.serve.controller --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000
```

### Launch a gradio web server.
```Shell
python -m align_anything.serve.gradio_web_server --controller http://localhost:10000 --model-list-mode reload
```
You have just launched the Gradio web interface. Now, you can open the web interface using the URL printed on the screen. You may notice that there are no models listed yet. Do not worry, as we have not launched any model workers yet. The model list will be automatically updated once you launch a model worker.

### Launch a model worker

This is the actual *worker* that performs the inference on the GPU.  Each worker is responsible for a single model specified in `--model-path`, and check the template.py in align_anything.configs to find the according template name.

```Shell
python -m align_anything.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path <ckpt>  --is-multimodal True --template "LLAVA"
```
Wait until the process completes loading the model and you see "Uvicorn running on ...". Then, refresh your Gradio web UI, and you will see the model you just started in the model list.

You can start as many workers as you need and compare different model checkpoints within the same Gradio interface. Ensure that you keep the `--controller` the same, but change the `--port` and `--worker` to a unique port number for each worker.

```Shell
python -m align_anything.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port <different from 40000, say 40001> --worker http://localhost:<change accordingly, i.e. 40001> --model-path <ckpt2> --is-multimodal True  --template "LLAVA"
```

You can specify the mps device by using the `--device` flag: `--device mps`, if you are using an Apple device with an M1 or M2 chip.

## Interactive Client

```bash
python3 -m align_anything.serve.cli --model_name_or_path your_model_name_or_path
```

![cli_demo](assets/cli_demo.gif)

## Interactive Arena

```bash
python3 -m align_anything.serve.arena --red_corner_model_name_or_path your_red_model_name_or_path --blue_corner_model_name_or_path your_blue_model_name_or_path
```

## Why do we open source align-anything?

Ensuring that the behavior of AI system aligns with human intentions and values is crucial, and alignment techniques provide an effective solution. For large language models (LLMs), methods such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) have significantly improved performance and safety. As models evolve to handle any-modality inputs and outputs, effectively aligning them remains a current research challenge. `Align-Anything` framework integrates alignment tuning across modalities using well-designed interfaces and advanced abstractions, offering a comprehensive testbed for research.
