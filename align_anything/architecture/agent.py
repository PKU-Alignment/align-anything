    Abstract base class for an agent.

    This class provides a template for agents that can be used in different environments.
    It declares methods that should be implemented by any concrete agent class.

        """
        Reset the agent's state.

        This method should be implemented by each subclass to reset the agent's internal state.
        It is typically called at the beginning of each episode.

        Get the list of possible actions.

        This method should be implemented by each subclass to return a list of possible actions
