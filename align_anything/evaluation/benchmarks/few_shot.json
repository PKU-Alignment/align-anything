        "question": "Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?",
        "answer": "Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.\nFor the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.\nAngelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.\nAnd they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.\nSo Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75\nThey will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\nThe answer is 4\n"

        "answer": "Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers.\nHis team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers\nThey scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free throws.\nAll together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points\nMark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100 points in 2 pointers.\nHis opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24/2= 12 points in 3 pointers.\nThey also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2=5 points in free throws.\nAll together Mark's opponents scored 100+12+5=117 points\nThe total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84+117=201 points\nThe answer is 201\n"

        "answer": "When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = 24\nThe total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = 84\nIf Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = 30 frisbees.\nIf Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.\nThe total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42\nBella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards\nIf she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards.\nThe total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = 14\nTogether, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items\nThe answer is 140\n"

        "answer": "Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133/7 = $19.\nThe total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $19 x 100 = $1900 is her monthly earnings.\nSo, $1900/2 = $950 is spent on her other monthly expenses.\nThe total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $950 = $1083.\nHence, she saves $1900 - $1083 = $817 per month.\nThe answer is 817\n"
