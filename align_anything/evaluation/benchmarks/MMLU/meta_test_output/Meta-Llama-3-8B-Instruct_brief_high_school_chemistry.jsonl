The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?\n(A) 0.500 mole\n(B) 1.00 mole\n(C) 2.00 mole\n(D) 3.00 mole\nAnswer: C\n\nSulfurous acid is a weak acid, while sulfuric acid is a much stronger acid because\n(A) the O–H bonds in sulfuric acid are much weaker than in sulfurous acid due to the electron withdrawing of the oxygen atoms on sulfuric acid\n(B) sulfuric acid has more oxygen atoms in its formula\n(C) the sulfur in sulfuric acid is more electronegative than the sulfur in sulfurous acid\n(D) sulfuric acid has the hydrogen atoms bound directly to the sulfur atom\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "outputs": [{"index": 0, "text": "The correct answer is A) the O–H bonds in sulfuric acid are much weaker than in sulfurous acid due to the electron withdrawing of the oxygen atoms on sulfuric acid.\n\nSulfurous acid (H2SO3) is a weak acid because it has a relatively strong O-H bond, which makes it difficult for the hydrogen ions to dissociate. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4), on the other hand, has two oxygen atoms that are bonded to the sulfur atom, which withdraws electrons from the O-H bonds and makes them weaker. This allows for easier dissociation of hydrogen ions and makes sulfuric acid a stronger acid."}]}
