A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?\nAnswer: C) By changing the shape of the protein\n\nThe location of an amino acid within an enzyme can affect its overall structure and function, even if it's not directly involved in catalysis (the active site).

Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?\nAnswer: A) Translation\n\nTranslation is not a method of forming recombinant DNA. The other options - conjugation, specialized transduction, and transformation - are all ways in which genetic material can be exchanged between organisms.\n\n2. A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?\nAnswer: C) By changing the shape of the protein\n\nThe location of an amino acid within an enzyme can affect its overall structure and function, even if it's not directly involved in catalysis (i.e., at or near the active site). Changes to non-active-site residues can influence substrate binding or recognition by altering protein conformation.\n\n3. In animal cells, which of the following represents the most likely pathway that a secretory protein takes as it is synthesized in a cell?\nAnswer: D) Ribosome–rough ER–Golgi apparatus–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane\n\nThis sequence reflects typical trafficking pathways for secreted proteins: translation on ribosomes, translocation into rough ER for folding and modification, transport through Golgi apparatus for further processing and packaging, formation of secretory vesicles containing mature proteins, and finally exocytosis across plasma membrane.\n\n4. Which of the following is not known to be involved in control of cell division?\nAnswer: D) Fibroblast cells\n\nFibroblast cells are types of connective tissue cells; they don't have anything specific to do with controlling cell division (which involves cyclins/protein kinases/checkpoints).\n\n5. Homologous structures are often cited as evidence for natural selection? All of which are examples EXCEPT\nAnswer: D) The forelegs of an insect and forelimbs dog\n\nHomologous structures share common ancestry but may have evolved different functions over time (e.g., wings vs legs). Options A-C show homologous structures with similar functions or adaptations; option D shows unrelated body parts with distinct purposes.\n\n6. Two unrelated species evolve in such way that makes them more similar.\n(A) Divergent evolution\n(B) Convergent evolution\n(C) Parallel evolution\n(D) Coevolution\n\nNone! These options describe different evolutionary processes:\n\n* Divergent evolution = species diverging from common ancestor.\n* Convergent evolution = unrelated species evolving similar traits independently.\n* Parallel evolution = related species evolving similar traits due to shared environmental pressures.\n* Coevolution = reciprocal evolutionary changes between interacting species (e.g., predator-prey relationships).\n\nThere isn't an option describing two unrelated species becoming more similar over time!"}]}
